This is a mini project for displaying local position's weather.

First of all, the app will check whether the browser supports "GeoLocation". If it supports, then app will get the current location for the latitude and longtitude.

Secondly, through the location data, I used API which is supported by OpenWeather website and get the weather details.

Note: before you run my code, you have to get your own account for OpenWeather and obtain your individual API key via subscribing some data collections. ("https://openweathermap.org/api")

After that, use html and javascript to display the weather details in frontend. One more function is that when you click the temperature, it will switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit. This is realized through eventlistener function.
